I am continuing with this account as I no longer have access to my previous one (https://github.com/oguzkaandemir). You can view my previous projects there.

I have over five years of experience in programming and technology. I entered the gaming industry in February 2022 and have been working as a Game Developer since then, acquiring extensive experience in game mechanics and design principles.

In addition to my work in game development, I have executed hardware and software projects using platforms like Arduino.
